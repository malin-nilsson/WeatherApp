# Vue Weather App

A simple weather app built with Vue.js that fetches weather from Open Weather Map. 

This was my first time building a project using Vue and I'm obsessed with it now. I chose to use the options API because the syntax looked a bit simpler as a beginner. For my next Vue project, I plan on trying out the composition API.
